  <h3 #projectStructure>Project structure</h3>
  <p>
    Project follows the module structure proposed by nrwl. There is one app,
    called 'people', and libs, used under this app.
  </p>
  <p>
    'People' app contains only a routing module. This routing module lazy loads
    given libs based on path in URL.
  </p>
  <p>There are 3 main grouping folders used for libs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a (click)="scrollToElement(personLib)">person</a> - used under '/person'
      URL
    </li>
    <li>
      <a (click)="scrollToElement(specificationLib)">specification</a> - used
      under '/specification' URL
    </li>
    <li>
      <a (click)="scrollToElement(sharedLib)">shared</a> - containing dummy
      components, resources etc. used by all libs
    </li>
  </ul>

    smart component is also responsible for opening a dialog with person details
    after entering an ID in URL. Dummy components, used by this feature library,
    are placed in

    >.
